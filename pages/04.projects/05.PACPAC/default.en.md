The project is about a tool for supporting end-users in the development of point-and-click videogames based on 360 degrees videos. It aims specifically at people without previous experience in game development and coding. Users can easily create scenes, add simple objects such as transitions or switches, connect scenes to each other and define the game rules. The tool is developed as a part of PAC-PAC, a project for promoting cultural and environmental heritage through videogames.



The project has been funded by [Sardegna Ricerche](https://www.regione.sardegna.it/) started in 
2017 and it will finish in 2020.
