The course provides an introduction to the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
field and to the main aspects involved in the human interaction with 
different devices. The course provides the concepts and the knowledge 
for understanding the human cognitive process for elaborating information, 
and the techniques and tools for designing, implementing and evaluating 
interfaces for interactive systems. In addition, we discuss the different 
modalities and platforms for creating user interfaces, from classical WIMP, 
to mobile, ubiquitous, distributed and natural interfaces.
